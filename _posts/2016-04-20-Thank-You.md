This is a fan tribute to Tim Bergling (É…VICII), musician, DJ, remixer and record producer.

Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii, was a Swedish DJ and producer who worked on live concerts. In 2011, his single ''Levels'' was on the 100 billboard chart. He was also known for ''Hey Brother''. He sometimes appeared on Radio 1's Pete Tong show. He was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and died in Muscat, Oman.

He will be deeply missed and never forgotten.
